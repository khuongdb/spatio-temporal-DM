# Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Model 

This is source code for my intern project, titled "Longitudinal Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD)". The internship was carried out with the Statity team at INRIA Grenoble.

As the project is still ongoing, the codebase is not yet fully cleaned, but it will be updated progressively.
